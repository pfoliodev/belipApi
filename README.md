# belipApi
Yutopia project for Belib API - Data course

![Description de l'image](static/img/leaflet.png)

I used a virtual environment to run the project.
To create the virtual environment, run the following command:
```bash
python -m venv venv
```
To activate the venv, run the following command:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

## Installation
All the dependencies are installed in the venv folder.
You can look at the requirement.txt file to see the dependencies.
And run the following command to install them:
pip install -r requirement.txt

## Running the project
To insert data into the database, you can run the insertData.py script.

## API
You can now run the main.py script to start the API.
